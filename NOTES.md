- `npm run test` seems to run in watch mode, should it be named something else?
- `grain-worker-test.ts` seems to contain redundant implementations of functionality from the non-test files. That seems like bad practice?
- Add agent instructions to avoid duplicating functionality.
- Update readme with new test instructions.
