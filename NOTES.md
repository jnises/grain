- [ ] `grain-worker.ts` seems to not use the functionality from `grain-generator.ts`. That is actually being tested?
- [ ] Remove hard to implement features of `ALGORITHM_DESIGN.md` such as parallax.
- [ ] Check to make sure the `Compositing Multiple Grain Layers` section of `ALGORITHM_DESIGN.md` makes sense.
- [ ] Go through `ALGORITHM_DESIGN.md` and compare against the current implementation. Describe what has been implemented and what hasn't any why.
- [ ] Add slider to control how large the grains are relative to the image, as if to simulate adjusting the enlargement factor of the image in a darkroom. (Or will this have the same effect as adjusting the iso?)
- [ ] Make sure the algorithm is gamma aware. Update the algorithm and the design document to be so if not.
