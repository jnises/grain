Commit all pending changes to git.

Before composing the commit message, run `git diff` and `git diff --cached` to review both staged and unstaged changes. Base the commit message on the actual code and file changes about to be committed, not just the contents of this conversation.

If `TODO.md` is among the changes, include it in the commit but do not mention it in the commit message.
