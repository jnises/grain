Commit all pending changes to git.

Before composing the commit message, run `git diff` and `git diff --cached` to review both staged and unstaged changes. Base the commit message on the actual code and file changes about to be committed, not just the contents of this conversation.

Follow good git commit message style with a brief description on the first line.

If `TODO.md` is among the changes, include it in the commit but do not mention it in the commit message.
