Find the first unchecked (sub?)item in TODO.md and act on it.
Start by checking if it is still applicable.
If it looks like a small task just do it.
Stop after you've completed the item.
If it looks like a bigger task first split it up into subtasks and add add those as subtasks to TODO.md, then ask the user for feedback on the subtasks before continuing.
