# Development Tools Directory

This directory contains development utilities and tools that provide ongoing value during development.

## Purpose

- **Development utilities**: Tools for debugging, analysis, and development workflow
- **Code generators**: Scripts that help automate repetitive development tasks
- **Analysis scripts**: Tools for understanding code behavior and performance
- **Development helpers**: Utilities that aid in the development process

## Guidelines

- Tools placed here should be documented and maintained if they're useful long-term
- Use TypeScript for new tools to maintain consistency with the project
- Include clear comments or documentation explaining the purpose and usage
- Consider adding npm scripts in the root `package.json` for frequently used tools

## Running Tools

Use `npx tsx scriptpath.ts` to run TypeScript tools directly from this directory.
