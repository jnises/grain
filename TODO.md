- [ ] Profile the code and try to optimize.
  - [x] Optimize grain generation performance (biggest bottleneck - 70% of CPU time) ✅ **COMPLETED** - 8x faster!
    - [x] Optimize `generateVariableSizeGrains` function in grain-generator.ts - Added IncrementalSpatialGrid using SpatialLookupGrid patterns
    - [x] Improve Poisson disk sampling efficiency - Eliminated redundant distance calculations with O(n) spatial partitioning
    - [x] Reduce failed attempt overhead in grain placement - Combined validation logic in incremental grid
    - [x] Reuse existing SpatialLookupGrid design patterns - Created incremental version for grain generation
    - [x] Performance results: ~900ms→109ms (8x faster), grain generation no longer bottleneck
  - [ ] Optimize pixel processing performance (second biggest bottleneck)
    - [ ] Optimize `calculatePixelGrainEffect` function in grain-processor.ts
    - [ ] Reduce grain lookup radius when possible
    - [ ] Improve spatial grid efficiency for grain queries. Perhaps grains can be added to all the cells they overlap and grainsNear could just need to look up a single cell?
    - [ ] Cache grain influence calculations where beneficial
  - [ ] Optimize iterative development loop
    - [ ] Use sampling for lightness estimation instead of full pixel processing
    - [ ] Reduce default iteration count from 5 to optimal value
    - [ ] Cache intermediate results between iterations
  - [ ] Optimize spatial grid operations

    - [ ] Optimize grid cell size and structure
    - [ ] Reduce unnecessary distance calculations
  - [ ] Memory and data structure optimizations
    - [ ] Improve data locality in hot loops
    - [ ] Use more efficient data structures for grain storage

    - [ ] Profile with different ISO settings to understand scaling behavior
- [ ] Merge IncrementalSpatialGrid with SpatialLookupGrid? SpatialLookupGrid requires all grain up front, but just to calculate the max size. Perhaps that could be separated out?
- [ ] reenable and fix these tests. If they still time out, try to make the dimensions of the testdata smaller. If that isn't possible just remove the test:
  - [ ] Fix and re-enable test: "should generate consistent grain properties" in test/grain-compositing.test.ts (timeout issue)
  - [ ] Fix and re-enable test: "should generate minimum viable grain count" in test/grain-distribution.test.ts (timeout issue)

- [ ] Write test of processImage with a testpattern with the left side fully white and the right side fully black. Use a low iso. The output image should be almost completely white on the left side and almost completely black on the right side
- [ ] Reenable these tests and make sure they pass
  - [ ] Reenable `test/grain-processor-integration.test.ts` > "should process gradient patterns correctly" and investigate why it outputs black.
  - [ ] Reenable `test/grain-processor-integration.test.ts` > "should process radial patterns correctly" and investigate why it outputs black.
  - [ ] Reenable `test/grain-processor-integration.test.ts` > "should produce different results for different film types" and investigate why it outputs black.
  - [ ] Reenable `test/iterative-vs-single-pass.test.ts` > "should demonstrate improved lightness preservation with iterative approach" and investigate why it outputs black.
  - [ ] Reenable `test/grain-physical-behavior.test.ts` > "should produce FEWER grains as ISO increases" and update the test to work with a smaller image to make it faster.
- [ ] Remove any constants from constants.ts that are not used anywhere or are only used in tests
- [ ] Move any constant in constants.ts that are only used a single place to that place and remove it from constants.ts
- [ ] Enable each test below one by one. Check if it passes. If not, determine if the code or the test is wrong (probably the test). If the test is wrong, determine if it is worth it to update the test or better to just remove it.

  - [ ] `test/grain-two-phase-verification.test.ts` > "Performance Characteristics" (describe.skip)
- [ ] Create a page like public/grain-debug.html that replicates the testpatterns from grain-processor-integration.test.ts
- [ ] Update the grain generation logic to do a full 3d emulsion simulation.
  - In real film grains are suspended at multiple depths, and can overlap.
  - In the current implementation we don't support overlapping.
  - Could just take the current grain generation and just have multiple at different depths?
  - refer to GRAIN_OVERLAPPING.md for some notes on the issue
  - Update ALGORITHM_DESIGN.md with the new functionality
- [ ] Add support for lower iso than 50
- [ ] Make sure the tests in grain-processor-integration.test.ts are not too lenient
- [ ] Add slider to control how large the grains are relative to the image, as if to simulate the image being a cropped version of a small sections of the negative. (Or will this have the same effect as adjusting the iso?)
- [ ] When loading an image in the gui, adjust the zoom level to show the entire image.
- [ ] Add support for scrolling/sliding the image in the gui. Both the unprocessed and processed images should scroll the same.
- [ ] Remove the explanatory text in the gui at the bottom.
- [ ] Remove the advanced section in the gui.
- [ ] Remove the grain center debug drawing functionality.
- [ ] Enable all skipped tests again. If they fail check if they are outdated and should be removed. If they are still applicable determine if the code or the test is wrong.
- [ ] Go through the testcases and make sure they are all enabled and makes sense
- [ ] Optimize the algorithm
- [ ] Clean up unused files and debug utils such as `public/grain-test.html`
- [ ] Clean up old agent-generated analysis and summary md files.
- [ ] Update dependencies.
- [ ] **Implement grain bridging and clustering effects**: Add simulation of grains connecting during development through clustering algorithms. This creates more realistic grain patterns that match actual film behavior.
- [ ] **Add edge effects near high-contrast boundaries**: Implement grain density changes near high-contrast image boundaries to simulate developer depletion and chemical diffusion effects.
- [ ] Is it possible to parallelize the algorithm? Or move parts of it to the gpu using webgpu?
- [ ] Look for TODO comments in the code, and list them as subitems here.
- [ ] Go through the repo and clean up any unused files
- [ ] Go through the code looking for repeating patterns and refactor them into shared code if it makes sense.
- [ ] The html files in public shouldn't be included in the production build
- [ ] Go through the code and clean up any comments left by a coding agent to indicate what it has changed. Comments should typically describe "why" not "what. And while comments describing changes is useful when iteracting with an agent we don't want that in the final code.
