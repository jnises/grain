- [x] Use something like a flamegraph to find the hotspots in the code and optimize those
- [x] Create a separate assert util for slow checks that is only run when in dev mode.
- [x] Update agent instructions on how to use the asserts.
- [x] Update hot code to use the dev assert. look for hot code using the profiling functionality as outlined in scripts/profiling/README.md
- [x] Figure out why `npm run profile` prints an empty table for `ðŸ”¥ Top CPU Hotspots (by self time):` and make it work
- [ ] Make sure `npm run preview` optimizes out devAssert
- [ ] Go through all README.md files and clean them up. remove any coding agent droppings. looks for inconsistent or outdated information and update or remove that.
- [ ] Go through the code and apply the rules around constants from the instructions
- [ ] Go through the code and check for types that can be made more descriptive. Either by creating a new class, or just us a type alias. For example things like `Map<GrainPoint, number>`. What does `number` represent there? If a non-bespoke type is used, make sure to document what it represents in a doc comment. For example is a `number` that represents a color in srgb or linear?
- [ ] Go through the code and make sure we are using idiomatic modern typescript. For example use ** instead of Math.pow. Update your instructions to make sure you use modern idiomatic typescript in the future.
- [ ] Enable each test below one by one. Check if it passes. If not, determine if the code or the test is wrong (probably the test). If the test is wrong, determine if it is worth it to update the test or better to just remove it.

- [ ] Create a page like public/grain-debug.html that replicates the testpatterns from grain-processor-integration.test.ts
- [ ] Update the grain generation logic to do a full 3d emulsion simulation.
  * In real film grains are suspended at multiple depths, and can overlap.
  * In the current implementation we don't support overlapping.
  * Could just take the current grain generation and just have multiple at different depths?
  * refer to GRAIN_OVERLAPPING.md for some notes on the issue
- [ ] Add support for lower iso than 50
- [ ] Make sure the tests in grain-processor-integration.test.ts are not too lenient
- [ ] Add slider to control how large the grains are relative to the image, as if to simulate the image being a cropped version of a small sections of the negative. (Or will this have the same effect as adjusting the iso?)
- [ ] Do the film type settings refer to common industry standard settings? Or do they just result in some made up parameters? If made up, convert them to use some non-brand names instead. Or expose the underlying parameters?
- [ ] In the gui make the unprocessed image also show as grayscale. Apply the same rgb to grayscale operation as in the grain processing pipeline.
- [ ] Enable all skipped tests again. If they fail check if they are outdated and should be removed. If they are still applicable determine if the code or the test is wrong.
- [ ] Go through the testcases and make sure they are all enabled and makes sense
- [ ] Optimize the algorithm
- [ ] Clean up unused files and debug utils such as `public/grain-test.html`
- [ ] Clean up old agent-generated analysis and summary md files.
- [ ] Update dependencies.
- [ ] **Add upsampling workflow for grain detail**: Implement 2x-4x upsampling before grain rendering, then downsample for final output. This will allow proper grain internal structure and edge softness instead of pixel-level noise.
- [ ] **Implement grain bridging and clustering effects**: Add simulation of grains connecting during development through clustering algorithms. This creates more realistic grain patterns that match actual film behavior.
- [ ] **Add edge effects near high-contrast boundaries**: Implement grain density changes near high-contrast image boundaries to simulate developer depletion and chemical diffusion effects.
- [ ] Is it possible to parallelize the algorithm? Or move parts of it to the gpu using webgpu?
- [ ] Look for TODO comments in the code, and list them as subitems here.
- [ ] Go through the repo and clean up any unused files
- [ ] Go through the code looking for repeating patterns and refactor them into shared code if it makes sense.
- [ ] The html files in public shouldn't be included in the production build
- [ ] Go through the code and clean up any comments left by a coding agent to indicate what it has changed. Comments should typically describe "why" not "what. And while comments describing changes is useful when iteracting with an agent we don't want that in the final code.
