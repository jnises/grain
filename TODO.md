- [x] Refactor GrainProcessor to allow us to specify the exact grains to use for processImage. Write a test that generates uniform grains on a dense grid and use those along with a middle gray test image for processImage. Test that the output is mostly uniform gray without much structure.
- [x] Change the grain debug drawing to show the size of the grains using color.
- [x] Do we have a test that checks the density of points generated using poisson disk sampling vs fallback? If not create one. The densities should be mostly the same.
- [x] Write a test of processImage supplying customGrains as an empty array. The output image should be completely black.
- [x] Keep track of the largest grain in SpatialLookupGrid and use that radius in getGrainsNear instead of specifying a custom one. Also make sure getGrainsNear with that radius would be sure to pick up all grains that could affect the requested position.
- [x] write an eslint rule to disallow raw Math.random instead RandomNumberGenerator should be dependency injected. The only allowed Math.random is in DefaultRandomNumberGenerator, and in test code.
- [x] Try disabling the kernel sampling and just use center sampling, to see if that affects the stripes.
      Didn't help :(
- [x] Add test for GrainProcessor.calculateGrainExposures that uses custom uniform grains on a dense grid, with imageData as middle gray. The output exposures should all be almost the same.
- [x] Write test for GrainDensityCalculator.calculateIntrinsicGrainDensities that uses custom uniform grains on a dense grid and uniform exposures in grainExposureMap. The result should have the same densities for all grains.
- [x] Write test for GrainProcessor.processPixelEffects that takes a uniform dense grid of grains as its grainIntrinsicDensityMap with a grainGrid to match. Check that the output does not have any stripes or other anisotropic effects.
- [x] Make sure there are tests that ensures that the grains generateGrainStructure returns don't have anisotropic structure. I'm currently seeing some diagonal stripes in the ouput. Perhaps this function could be the culprit..
      Created comprehensive anisotropy tests in `grain-structure-anisotropy.test.ts`. Found minor directional bias at low ISO (ratio ~2.2) due to Poisson generation limitations, but acceptable levels overall. Fallback grid method shows excellent isotropy (ratio ~1.06).
- [x] Also write tests to make sure the sensitivity and developmentThreshold of the grains don't have a directional bias. Don't just check for horizontal, vertical or diagonal. The strips I'm seeing is somewhere between horizontal and diagonal.
- [x] Update grain-debug.html to also visualize grain sensitivity and developmentThreshold
- [ ] Examine why the algorithm introduces striped patterns. Look at gray.png grain-processed-image.png
- [ ] Write test of processImage with a testpattern with the left side fully white and the right side fully black. Use a low iso. The output image should be almost completely white on the left side and almost completely black on the right side
- [ ] Reenable these tests and make sure they pass
  - [ ] Reenable `test/grain-processor-integration.test.ts` > "should process gradient patterns correctly" and investigate why it outputs black.
  - [ ] Reenable `test/grain-processor-integration.test.ts` > "should process radial patterns correctly" and investigate why it outputs black.
  - [ ] Reenable `test/grain-processor-integration.test.ts` > "should produce different results for different film types" and investigate why it outputs black.
  - [ ] Reenable `test/iterative-vs-single-pass.test.ts` > "should demonstrate improved lightness preservation with iterative approach" and investigate why it outputs black.
  - [ ] Reenable `test/grain-physical-behavior.test.ts` > "should produce FEWER grains as ISO increases" and update the test to work with a smaller image to make it faster.
- [ ] Remove any constants from constants.ts that are not used anywhere or are only used in tests
- [ ] Move any constant in constants.ts that are only used a single place to that place and remove it from constants.ts
- [ ] Enable each test below one by one. Check if it passes. If not, determine if the code or the test is wrong (probably the test). If the test is wrong, determine if it is worth it to update the test or better to just remove it.

- [ ] Create a page like public/grain-debug.html that replicates the testpatterns from grain-processor-integration.test.ts
- [ ] Update the grain generation logic to do a full 3d emulsion simulation.
  - In real film grains are suspended at multiple depths, and can overlap.
  - In the current implementation we don't support overlapping.
  - Could just take the current grain generation and just have multiple at different depths?
  - refer to GRAIN_OVERLAPPING.md for some notes on the issue
  - Update ALGORITHM_DESIGN.md with the new functionality
- [ ] Refactor functions like processPixelEffects to instead of iterating over pixels and using the spatial lookup grid it should iterate over grains and "render" those to the output image. Make sure it actually improves performance
- [ ] Add support for lower iso than 50
- [ ] Make sure the tests in grain-processor-integration.test.ts are not too lenient
- [ ] Add slider to control how large the grains are relative to the image, as if to simulate the image being a cropped version of a small sections of the negative. (Or will this have the same effect as adjusting the iso?)
- [ ] Do the film type settings refer to common industry standard settings? Or do they just result in some made up parameters? If made up, convert them to use some non-brand names instead. Or expose the underlying parameters?
- [ ] In the gui make the unprocessed image also show as grayscale. Apply the same rgb to grayscale operation as in the grain processing pipeline.
- [ ] Enable all skipped tests again. If they fail check if they are outdated and should be removed. If they are still applicable determine if the code or the test is wrong.
- [ ] Go through the testcases and make sure they are all enabled and makes sense
- [ ] Optimize the algorithm
- [ ] Clean up unused files and debug utils such as `public/grain-test.html`
- [ ] Clean up old agent-generated analysis and summary md files.
- [ ] Update dependencies.
- [ ] **Implement grain bridging and clustering effects**: Add simulation of grains connecting during development through clustering algorithms. This creates more realistic grain patterns that match actual film behavior.
- [ ] **Add edge effects near high-contrast boundaries**: Implement grain density changes near high-contrast image boundaries to simulate developer depletion and chemical diffusion effects.
- [ ] Is it possible to parallelize the algorithm? Or move parts of it to the gpu using webgpu?
- [ ] Look for TODO comments in the code, and list them as subitems here.
- [ ] Go through the repo and clean up any unused files
- [ ] Go through the code looking for repeating patterns and refactor them into shared code if it makes sense.
- [ ] The html files in public shouldn't be included in the production build
- [ ] Go through the code and clean up any comments left by a coding agent to indicate what it has changed. Comments should typically describe "why" not "what. And while comments describing changes is useful when iteracting with an agent we don't want that in the final code.
