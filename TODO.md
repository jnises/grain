- [x] grainGenerators use of seededRandom looks problematic. use a better prng algorithm than just Math.sin. wanghash perhaps? or perhaps just an off the shelf cryptographic random generator?
  when using grain index as input I wouldn't be surprised if you get patterns in the output with the current bad rng.
  - [x] Research and implement better PRNG algorithm (Wang hash, xorshift, or similar)
  - [x] Replace Math.sin-based seededRandom function in grain-math.ts
  - [x] Update SeededRandomNumberGenerator class in grain-generator.ts to use new algorithm
  - [x] Improve seeding strategy to avoid patterns from grain indices (hash the index before use)
  - [x] Update all direct seededRandom calls to use better seed distribution
  - [x] Add tests to verify new PRNG has good statistical properties
  - [x] Test that visual patterns are reduced with new PRNG
  - [x] Update constants and remove SEEDED_RANDOM_MULTIPLIER if no longer needed
  - [x] assert that the wanghash input is indeed an integer
  - [x] Since the hashing functions are likely to be quite hot, they should use devAssert rather than a normal assert
- [x] make sure devAsserts work in tests. make sure they are enabled and that they properly fail the test
- [x] wanghash and xorshift made the visual patters even more prominent unfortunately. try something like squirrel3?
      Implemented Squirrel Noise 5 algorithm to replace Wang Hash. Updated grain-math.ts with squirrelNoise5() function, updated all references in grain-generator.ts, and renamed/updated test file to squirrel-noise-properties.test.ts. All tests pass and the new PRNG is now active in the grain generation system.
- [x] The rng algorithms operate on integers, but the code just does Math.floor on the input. This silently throws away the fraction. The current code asserts that the input is finite, which isn't enough. If an algorithm requires an integer you MUST assert (devAssert) that it is actually an integer. Also, update your instructions to make sure you do this properly in the future.
      Added proper integer assertions to squirrelNoise5(), hashSeed(), and seededRandom() functions. Replaced Math.floor() conversions with devAssert(() => Number.isInteger(value)) to prevent silent data loss. Fixed grain-generator.ts to use integer arithmetic (attempts * 1234 + 1) instead of decimal multipliers (attempts * 12.34). Updated tests to expect integer assertion failures for non-integer inputs. The guidance was already present in copilot-instructions.md.

- [ ] Remove any constants from constants.ts that are not used anywhere or are only used in tests
- [ ] Move any constant in constants.ts that are only used a single place to that place and remove it from constants.ts
- [ ] Enable each test below one by one. Check if it passes. If not, determine if the code or the test is wrong (probably the test). If the test is wrong, determine if it is worth it to update the test or better to just remove it.

- [ ] Create a page like public/grain-debug.html that replicates the testpatterns from grain-processor-integration.test.ts
- [ ] Update the grain generation logic to do a full 3d emulsion simulation.
  - In real film grains are suspended at multiple depths, and can overlap.
  - In the current implementation we don't support overlapping.
  - Could just take the current grain generation and just have multiple at different depths?
  - refer to GRAIN_OVERLAPPING.md for some notes on the issue
  - Update ALGORITHM_DESIGN.md with the new functionality
- [ ] Refactor functions like processPixelEffects to instead of iterating over pixels and using the spatial lookup grid it should iterate over grains and "render" those to the output image. Make sure it actually improves performance
- [ ] Add support for lower iso than 50
- [ ] Make sure the tests in grain-processor-integration.test.ts are not too lenient
- [ ] Add slider to control how large the grains are relative to the image, as if to simulate the image being a cropped version of a small sections of the negative. (Or will this have the same effect as adjusting the iso?)
- [ ] Do the film type settings refer to common industry standard settings? Or do they just result in some made up parameters? If made up, convert them to use some non-brand names instead. Or expose the underlying parameters?
- [ ] In the gui make the unprocessed image also show as grayscale. Apply the same rgb to grayscale operation as in the grain processing pipeline.
- [ ] Enable all skipped tests again. If they fail check if they are outdated and should be removed. If they are still applicable determine if the code or the test is wrong.
- [ ] Go through the testcases and make sure they are all enabled and makes sense
- [ ] Optimize the algorithm
- [ ] Clean up unused files and debug utils such as `public/grain-test.html`
- [ ] Clean up old agent-generated analysis and summary md files.
- [ ] Update dependencies.
- [ ] **Implement grain bridging and clustering effects**: Add simulation of grains connecting during development through clustering algorithms. This creates more realistic grain patterns that match actual film behavior.
- [ ] **Add edge effects near high-contrast boundaries**: Implement grain density changes near high-contrast image boundaries to simulate developer depletion and chemical diffusion effects.
- [ ] Is it possible to parallelize the algorithm? Or move parts of it to the gpu using webgpu?
- [ ] Look for TODO comments in the code, and list them as subitems here.
- [ ] Go through the repo and clean up any unused files
- [ ] Go through the code looking for repeating patterns and refactor them into shared code if it makes sense.
- [ ] The html files in public shouldn't be included in the production build
- [ ] Go through the code and clean up any comments left by a coding agent to indicate what it has changed. Comments should typically describe "why" not "what. And while comments describing changes is useful when iteracting with an agent we don't want that in the final code.
